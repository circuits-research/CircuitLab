**CLT-Forge** is a Mechanistic Interpretability Toolkit for jointly training [Cross-Layer Transcoders](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html) (CLTs), running the auto-interp, computing the attribution-graph, and interact with a visual interface. We will soon release open-source CLTs with the library (up to 8B parameters), along with automated interpretation and code for interacting with existing open-source CLTs (e.g., Gemma 2B), enabling direct comparisons within a unified framework. We are currently adding extensions for lower-compute academic budget (e.g. low-rank finetuning of CLTs, ...). 

We believe that a major limitation in the development of CLTs, and more broadly attribution graph methods, is the significant engineering effort required to train, analyze, and iterate on them. This library aims to reduce that overhead by providing a clean, scalable, and extensible framework for academia. 

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate and cache activations

``` python
from clt_forge import ActivationsStore, clt_training_runner_config, load_model

# Load model
model = load_model("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B", device="cuda")

# Create config
cfg = clt_training_runner_config()

# Create activation store
store = ActivationsStore(model, cfg)

# Generate and cache activations
store.generate_and_save_activations(
    path=cfg.cached_activations_path,
    use_compression=True,  # optional
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Train the CLT

``` python
from clt_forge import CLTTrainingRunner

# Train
trainer = CLTTrainingRunner(cfg)
trainer.run()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Running the AutoInterp

``` python
from clt_forge import AutoInterp, AutoInterpConfig

# Create config
cfg = AutoInterpConfig(
  model_name = model_name,
  clt_path = "path/to/checkpoint",
)

# Generate
autointerp = AutoInterp(cfg)
autointerp.run("where/to/save")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Computing the Attribution Graph

``` python
from clt_forge import AttributionRunner

runner = AttributionRunner(
  model_name = model_name,
  clt_path = "path/to/checkpoint",
)
graph = runner.run(
  input_str = 'The opposite of "large" is ',
  folder = "where/to/save"
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Start the Visual-Interface

``` python
from clt_forge.frontend import main, AppConfig

cfg = AppConfig(
  graph_path = "path/to/graph", 
  autointerp_path = "path/to/autointerp"
)

main(cfg)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

This library currently implements L1-regularized [JumpReLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14435) CLTs with the following design principles:

- Follows Anthropic's [training guidelines]((https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/january-update/index.html))
- Supports feature sharding across GPUs (as well as DDP and FSDP)  
- Includes activation caching and compression/quantization of the activations  
- Adopts a structure similar to [SAE Lens](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens) (code design, activation-store, etc.) and uses [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens)
- Includes a visual interface for exploring features and attribution graphs:
  - Similar in spirit (but simpler) to [Neuronpedia](https://github.com/hijohnnylin/neuronpedia)
  - Soon including attention-attribution support (as in [SparseAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05865))

We welcome contributions to the library. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and templates.

## ⚙️ Notes
- Training happens in **multiple steps**:
  1.  **Precompute activations** (should be parallelized across indepedent jobs)
  2.  **Train the CLT model** on the cached activations (should run on a single multi-gpu node)
  3.  **Run the AutoInterp** (should be parallelized across indepedent jobs)
  4.  **Compute the Attribution-Graph** (runs on a single GPU)
  5.  **Visualize the Attribution-Graph**

-   We provide screenshot examples of training metrics in the [output](./outputs) folder and sample training scripts in [runners](./runners/)
-   Compression is optional but recommended for large-scale runs (e.g. 1B +) with 4-8x memory reduction
-   Training with bf16 is fine (autocasting with activations and weights in bf16 but gradient states in 32) but requires higher lr (around 1.5-2x bigger)
-   For Llama 1B, on a full 8 gpu H100 node, we reach an expansion factor of 42 with micro-batch size 512
-   The Visual-Interface is a simple python Dash code that is easily modifiable for your projects !
